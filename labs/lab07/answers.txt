NOTE:
- Your time complexities should be expressed in big-O notation and be in
  terms of n, where n is the number of people who  have  been  added  to
  Friendbook.

- Worst case time complexity: O(log n)

- Explanation: time complexity of nameToId is log n as it searches in a AVL tree.
Referring to a 2d array is O(1). For this funciton O(2log n + 1) == O(log n).

FbMutualFriends
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n)

- Explanation: Iteration through users is O(n). Referring to array, ListAppend and 
ListNew are all O(1). So this function is O(n).

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^2)

- Explanation: Calloc is O(n). Loop for calculating mutual friends is O(n^2) as 
FbMutualFriends is called in loop. Printing loop is also O(n^2). So time complexity
of this function is O(n^2).

===============
 FbFriendRecs2
===============

- Worst case time complexity: O(n^3)

- Explanation: Loop for calculating path length called findMinPathLen(). 
findMinPathLen() is O(n^2) as there is a nested loop. So loop for calculating
path length is O(n^3). Loop for printing is O(n). Time complexity for this funciton
is O(n^3).
